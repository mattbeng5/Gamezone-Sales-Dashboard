# Gamezone-Sales-Data
Analyzing Sales Data from Gamezone

### Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive sales dashboard which will track revenue, order counts, average order value over time and by product category. 

### Tools
1. Google Sheets was used for data cleaning and to create pivot tables to compute initial aggregations.
2. SQL was used to write queries to stratify data by region, channel, and category.
3. Power BI was used to create visualizations: time-series line charts, bar charts, and slicers.
